# Introduction
With Recipes you can write your first draft using our built-in or custom guides.

Unlike other writing software, **you can't edit**.<br> You write here, and then export to use where you usually write such as Org-Roam, Obsidian or Logseq.


## Getting Started
### Application Files
See our releases page for the latest file that you can download and run with no extra dependencies.

### NPM
Alternatively, if you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
You can try it with: <br>
`npx writes`

And then install with: <br>
`npm install writes -g`



## Instructions
Recipes uses keyboard based navigation. <br>
You perform actions by first opening the command panel, and then typing what you want the application to do. <br>
*(It's not AI, so you need to follow the particular formats shown below)*

1. Open the command panel with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Space`, or by pressing the `` ` `` key.

2. Type any of the commands below:
- `help` : show instructions
- `close` : hide instructions
- `start <guide>` : clears the current entry and starts a guided flow. Options are: `poem`, `dream`, and `journal`. <br>
for example, `start poem` will start the recipe for writing a poem.
- `next` : moves to the next step in the current guide!
- `add <surface>` : add a writing surface. Options are: `markdown`, `poem` and `plain`. It defaults to `markdown`
- `recycle`: clears the current entry
- `save`: exports your entry based on your configuration file
- `exit`: exits the application

## Make Your Own Guides
The true joy of Recipes is when you go off script and create your own guides. <br>
There may be a particular structure that you love (mine is \`the work\` by Byron Katie)

You can create your own guides by following <u>these instructions</u>
