;; State is stored in a series of atoms that are restricted to this namespace.
;; I felt comfortable doing it in this rag-tag way because I had a good idea of the
;; scope of the application and what was needed going into the project.
;; There are some atoms that are initialized when we read config files,n
;; there are some atoms that deal with application state, such as which input to focus on,
;; and there are some constants at the bottom that we can probably move to the config file

;; The user profile data. This includes their name and config options
(defonce user-data* (r/atom nil))

;; The user's save-log. This keeps a track of how many characters they save to perform streak/word target calculations.

;; In this `inkjs` inputs need to be explicitly disabled when not in use
;; otherwise they will continue to receive input.
